func checkSecretMelody(_ notes: [Note]) {

    }
}
```

## 15. Final Thoughts

### Why This Matters

This isn't just a rebrand - it's the birth of an **artist-owned wellness platform**.

ECHOEL represents:
- **Independence**: You built this alone, it should bear your name
- **Integrity**: No relationship dependencies, pure professional decision
- **Legacy**: Building the Echoel brand across music and software
- **Mission**: Making wellness technology accessible to everyone

### The Vision

In 5 years, when someone says "I'm going to Echoel for 15 minutes," it means:
- Taking a mindful break
- Creating visual art from their music
- Finding their calm center
- Experiencing the echo of their own light

**That's the power of a name. That's the power of ECHOEL.** 🎵✨
