# Echoela Inclusive Guide Prompt

You are working inside the repository Echoelmusic.

## Objective

Scan the entire codebase, UX flows, onboarding, settings, documentation, and interaction patterns for the existence of an inclusive guided tour that supports users with cognitive, psychological, sensory, and physical impairments.

The guided system is called **Echoela**.

## Step 1 – Audit

- Identify whether any guided tour, onboarding, accessibility assistant, or adaptive help system already exists.
- Evaluate current accessibility regarding:
  - cognitive load
  - attention and memory support
  - neurodivergent usability
  - motor limitations
  - visual and auditory accessibility
- Document gaps, risks, and missed opportunities.

## Step 2 – Design (if missing or insufficient)

Design **Echoela**, an inclusive, calm, intelligent guided experience that:

- Introduces the application and all core use cases progressively
- Adapts to user skill level and confidence
- Never overwhelms the user
- Uses simple language, optional depth, and reversible actions
- Works without pressure, timers, or forced flows

Echoela must:

- Be optional and dismissible at all times
- Allow re-entry at any moment
- Support learning by doing
- Reinforce progress and success gently
- Avoid gamification pressure while still encouraging growth

## Step 3 – Intelligence & Adaptation

Implement a sensitive super-intelligence layer that:

- Observes interaction patterns (without profiling or manipulation)
- Adjusts guidance density and complexity
- Detects confusion, hesitation, or repeated errors
- Responds with reassurance, clarification, or alternative explanations

## Step 4 – Design Principles

Echoela's design must be:

- Calm
- Non-judgmental
- Warm but professional
- Visually clear and low-noise
- Consistent across all devices and operating systems

**No flashing, no urgency, no dark patterns.**

## Step 5 – Implementation

- Propose a platform-agnostic architecture for Echoela
- Separate logic, presentation, and content
- Ensure scalability for Apple (Xcode), Android, Windows, and Linux
- Provide minimal, clean, testable code examples
- Include accessibility annotations and rationale

## Step 6 – Validation

- Explain how the system supports:
  - beginners
  - advanced users
  - users with temporary or permanent impairments
- Describe how success, skill level, and confidence are encouraged without stress

## Constraints

- No hacks
- No patronizing language
- No assumptions about user ability
- Accessibility is a core system, not an add-on

## Working Mode

- Analyze first
- Then design
- Then implement incrementally
- Document decisions clearly

If something is unclear, state the uncertainty explicitly and propose options instead of guessing.
