### 5.6 Motion & Animation

#### **Principles**

1. **Purposeful**: Every animation has a reason
2. **Quick**: Mobile users expect speed (<300ms)
3. **Natural**: Use easing curves (not linear)
4. **Subtle**: Don't distract from content

#### **Animation Timing**

**Micro-interactions** (buttons, switches):
- Duration: 150ms
- Easing: Ease-out

**Page transitions**:
- Duration: 300ms
- Easing: Ease-in-out

**Modal presentations**:
- Duration: 400ms
- Easing: Spring (dampening: 0.8)

**Fades**:
- Duration: 200ms
- Easing: Linear

#### **Signature Animations**

**Logo Animation** (app launch):
```
1. EOEL letters appear individually (stagger 50ms)
2. Gradient washes through (200ms)
3. Slight scale bounce (spring animation)
Total: 800ms
```

**Quantum Visualization** (JUMPER matching):
```
1. Particles appear in superposition (scattered)
2. Quantum collapse animation (converging)
3. Match revealed with glow effect
Total: 2000ms
```

**Waveform Animation** (audio playback):
```
1. Real-time amplitude visualization
2. Color shift based on frequency
3. Smooth interpolation (60fps)
Continuous while playing
```
