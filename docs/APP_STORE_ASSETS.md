## App Description

### Short Description (iOS)

Transform your heartbeat into music. Let your brainwaves shape the sound.

Echoelmusic creates a living bridge between your body and audio. Using real-time biofeedback from your Apple Watch, the app generates personalized soundscapes that respond to your physiological state.

**8 Scientifically-Designed Modes:**
• Meditation - Theta waves for deep calm
• Focus - Beta frequencies for concentration
• Sleep - Delta rhythms for rest
• Creativity - Theta-Alpha for flow states
• Energy - High-frequency activation
• Recovery - Alpha for restoration
• Balanced - Optimal equilibrium
• Custom - Your personalized settings

**Core Features:**
• Real-time heart rate and HRV integration
• Binaural beats (requires headphones)
• Isochronic tones (works with speakers)
• 5 waveforms and pulse shapes
• Spatial 3D audio with head tracking
• Apple Watch companion app
• Individual frequency calibration
• Beautiful, calming visualizations

**How It Works:**
1. Connect your Apple Watch
2. Choose your target state
3. Start a session
4. Your biometrics shape the audio in real-time
5. High stress? More calming frequencies
6. Good coherence? Enhanced harmonics

**Perfect For:**
• Meditation and mindfulness practice
• Deep focus and productivity sessions
• Sleep improvement and insomnia relief
• Stress reduction and relaxation
• Creative flow states and brainstorming
• Workout recovery and regeneration

**Science-Backed:**
Built on peer-reviewed research in neuroscience and psychophysiology. Evidence levels clearly marked for each feature. Not a medical device.

**Privacy First:**
Your health data stays on your device. We never upload or sell your biometric information.

### Full Description (macOS)

**Echoelmusic: Where Your Body Becomes the Instrument**

Experience the world's first truly bio-reactive audio platform. Echoelmusic doesn't just play music—it creates a living soundscape that breathes with you, adapts to your stress levels, and guides you toward your desired mental state.

**Revolutionary Biofeedback Integration**

Connect your Apple Watch and watch as your heart rate variability (HRV) shapes every aspect of the sound. When you're stressed, the system responds with calming theta frequencies. As you achieve coherence, the harmonics become richer and more complex. It's not just listening—it's a conversation between you and sound.

**Professional Audio Engine**

• 6 synthesis engines (subtractive, FM, wavetable, granular, additive, physical modeling)
• Binaural beat generation with precise frequency control
• Isochronic tone generator with EFx modeling chain
• Spatial audio with head tracking for immersive experiences
• AUv3 plugin for integration with Logic Pro, Ableton, and more

**Autopilot System**

Set your target state and let Echoelmusic guide you there:

| Mode | Target State | Method |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Meditation | Theta 4-8 Hz | Gradual descent into calm |
| Focus | Beta 15-25 Hz | Sharp, engaging frequencies |
| Sleep | Delta 0.5-4 Hz | Deep, slow rhythms |
| Creativity | Theta-Alpha 6-10 Hz | Fluid, imaginative space |
| Energy | Beta-Gamma 20-40 Hz | Activating, uplifting |
| Recovery | Alpha 8-13 Hz | Restorative, balanced |

**For Professionals**

• 100 Hz control loop for responsive biofeedback
• Comprehensive API for app integration
• CoreML support for custom mental state detection
• Export sessions for research and analysis

**System Requirements**
• macOS 14.0 or later
• Apple Watch recommended for biofeedback
• Headphones recommended for binaural beats
