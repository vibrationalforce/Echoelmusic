## Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Swift Files | 328 | - | OK |
| Total Lines (Swift) | 172,114 | - | OK |
| Test Files | 15 | 60+ | LOW |
| Test Coverage | ~4.5% | 60%+ | CRITICAL |
| TODO/FIXME | 66 | <20 | NEEDS WORK |
| print() statements | 147+ | 0 | NEEDS FIX |
| Force unwraps | 42+ | 0 | NEEDS FIX |
| fatalError() | 0 (fixed) | 0 | OK |

## Recent Improvements

### Session 2024-11-28
- Removed all fatalError() from production code (4 locations)
- Replaced force casts (as!) with safe compactMap
- Added HTTPS option for SmartLightingAPIs
- Created EchoelmusicMasterEngine (master orchestrator)
- Created HyperPotentialEngine (AI optimization)
- Created DependencyResolutionError for proper error handling

## Critical Paths Needing Tests

1. **Audio Engine** - Core DSP processing
2. **MIDI Controller** - Real-time MIDI handling
3. **Video Pipeline** - Encoding/streaming
4. **Biofeedback** - HRV/EEG processing
5. **OSC Communication** - Network protocol

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Replace print() with EchoelLogger (147+ occurrences)
2. Expand test coverage to critical audio paths
3. Address TODO/FIXME backlog (66 items)

### Medium Priority
1. Document public APIs
2. Add performance benchmarks
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Cost Efficiency Notes

- This scan: Single pass, cached results
- Next deep scan: Scheduled for next week
- Incremental scans: After commits only
