# Healing Log — Persistent Session Memory

## Purpose
This file tracks ALL code healing sessions across Claude Code contexts.
Read this FIRST when continuing work on Echoelmusic.

## Session: 2026-02-27 (3 rounds)

**Directive:** "Alles was realistisch ist und Sinn macht auf 100% bringen. Alles andere zur Seite."

**Approach:** 3-agent parallel audits × 3 rounds

**Result:** 23 files fixed, 0 regressions, 2 CRASH bugs prevented, 1 disconnected pipeline reconnected

**Commits:**
1. `fix: deep code healing — 4 crash bugs, security, CI alignment, platform guards`
2. `docs: update Feature Matrix with comprehensive 3-agent audit (2026-02-27)`
3. `fix: architecture healing — crash bugs, audio→visual pipeline, divide-by-zero guards`

**Key Discovery:** Audio→Visual pipeline was completely disconnected. MicrophoneManager published data but nothing subscribed. Fixed by wiring `$audioBuffer` → `EchoelUniversalCore.receiveAudioData()` in `connectSystems()`.

## How to Use This File

When starting a new session:
1. Read `scratchpads/HEALING_LOG.md` (this file) for session history
2. Read `scratchpads/ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_2026-02-27.md` for current architecture state
3. Check `docs/dev/FEATURE_MATRIX.md` for feature readiness
4. Run `swift build` to verify current build state
5. Then proceed with the new task
