# Healing Log — Persistent Session Memory

## Purpose
This file tracks ALL code healing sessions across Claude Code contexts.
Read this FIRST when continuing work on Echoelmusic.

## Session: 2026-02-27 — ProMixEngine Audio Routing

**Directive:** "Alles so wie du sagst" — Implement ProMixEngine audio routing (Tier 1 priority)

**Approach:** Deep codebase analysis → MixerDSPKernel design → Integration → Tests

**Result:** ProMixEngine upgraded from data-model-only to real audio processing

**New Files:**
- `Sources/Echoelmusic/Audio/MixerDSPKernel.swift` — Real-time DSP kernel (per-channel buffers, insert chains, send routing, bus summing, metering)
- `Tests/EchoelmusicTests/MixerDSPKernelTests.swift` — 30+ tests for real audio signal flow

**Modified Files:**
- `Sources/Echoelmusic/Audio/ProMixEngine.swift` — Integrated MixerDSPKernel, added `processAudioBlock()` API, replaced stub DSP with real processing
- `Sources/Echoelmusic/Audio/AudioEngine.swift` — Added `connectMixer()` and `routeAudioThroughMixer()` bridge

**What Changed:**
1. **Per-channel audio buffers** — Each channel strip now has allocated AVAudioPCMBuffers
2. **Insert chain processing** — InsertSlots map to real EchoelmusicNode instances (FilterNode, CompressorNode, ReverbNode, DelayNode) with dry/wet blend
3. **Equal-power pan law** — Proper `cos(θ)/sin(θ)` constant-power stereo panning
4. **Send routing** — Pre/post-fader sends mix into aux bus buffers with correct gain
5. **Bus summing** — Real audio summing of routed channels into buses and master
6. **Real metering** — Peak, RMS, peak-hold, phase correlation from vDSP-accelerated buffer analysis
7. **Phase invert** — Working polarity inversion with cancellation verified in tests
8. **Master processing** — Master channel inserts + volume applied to final output
9. **vDSP acceleration** — All buffer ops use Accelerate framework (vDSP_vsma, vDSP_vsmul, vDSP_rmsqv, etc.)

**Feature Matrix Impact:**
- ProMixEngine: PARTIAL → **REAL** (was data-model-only, now has full audio routing)
- 30+ new tests covering signal flow, not just data model

## Session: 2026-02-27 (3 rounds)

**Directive:** "Alles was realistisch ist und Sinn macht auf 100% bringen. Alles andere zur Seite."

**Approach:** 3-agent parallel audits × 3 rounds

**Result:** 23 files fixed, 0 regressions, 2 CRASH bugs prevented, 1 disconnected pipeline reconnected

**Commits:**
1. `fix: deep code healing — 4 crash bugs, security, CI alignment, platform guards`
2. `docs: update Feature Matrix with comprehensive 3-agent audit (2026-02-27)`
3. `fix: architecture healing — crash bugs, audio→visual pipeline, divide-by-zero guards`

**Key Discovery:** Audio→Visual pipeline was completely disconnected. MicrophoneManager published data but nothing subscribed. Fixed by wiring `$audioBuffer` → `EchoelUniversalCore.receiveAudioData()` in `connectSystems()`.

## How to Use This File

When starting a new session:
1. Read `scratchpads/HEALING_LOG.md` (this file) for session history
2. Read `scratchpads/ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_2026-02-27.md` for current architecture state
3. Check `docs/dev/FEATURE_MATRIX.md` for feature readiness
4. Run `swift build` to verify current build state
5. Then proceed with the new task
