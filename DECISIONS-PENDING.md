## Active Evolution Tasks

### REFACTOR-001: Migrate print() to EchoelLogger

**Status**: QUEUED (Incremental)
**Impact**: Medium (147+ occurrences)
**Approach**: Incremental - migrate highest-impact files first

#### Progress
- [ ] PrivacyManager.swift (18 occurrences)
- [ ] StreamEngine.swift (13 occurrences)
- [ ] VideoEditingEngine.swift (16 occurrences)
- [ ] CollaborationEngine.swift (12 occurrences)
- [ ] Remaining files (100+ occurrences)

Will execute incrementally in future sessions for cost efficiency.

### TEST-001: Expand Test Coverage

**Status**: QUEUED
**Target**: 60%+ coverage (from ~4.5%)

#### Priority Order
1. Core audio processing (safety-critical)
2. MIDI handling
3. Video encoding/streaming
4. Biofeedback processing
5. Network/OSC communication

Will execute incrementally as part of evolution cycle.

### ARCH-001: Unified Engine Integration

**Status**: Informational (No action required)
**Impact**: Already Implemented

#### Summary
The following engines have been unified under EchoelmusicMasterEngine:
- QuantumFlowEngine
- UltraHardSinkEngine
- EnergyScienceEngine
- HyperPotentialEngine
- QuantumUniversalEngine
- DeepAccessibilityEngine
- VisionCorrectionEngine

All engines now register with `EngineRegistry` and share:
- Production-safe logging
- Self-healing capabilities
- Resource management
- Performance monitoring

**No action required** - documenting completed architecture decision.
