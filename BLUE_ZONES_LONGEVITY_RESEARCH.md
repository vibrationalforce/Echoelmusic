## 💊 Binaural Beats & Hemisync (Robert Monroe)

### **History & Mechanism**

Robert Monroe (1915-1995) pioneered Hemisync technology at The Monroe Institute.

**How it works:**
- Play slightly different frequencies to each ear
- Brain perceives a third "beat" (the difference)
- Example: 200 Hz left ear, 210 Hz right ear = 10 Hz binaural beat
- Brainwave entrainment to target frequency

---

### **Brainwave States & Frequencies**

| State | Frequency | Mental State | Hemisync Use |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Delta** | 0.5-4 Hz | Deep sleep, healing | Sleep induction, pain relief |
| **Theta** | 4-8 Hz | Meditation, REM, creativity | Deep meditation, memory enhancement |
| **Alpha** | 8-13 Hz | Relaxed focus, learning | Flow state, stress reduction |
| **Beta** | 13-30 Hz | Alert, focused, active | Concentration, cognitive performance |
| **Gamma** | 30-100 Hz | Peak performance, insight | Problem-solving, peak states |

---

### **Evidence Base**
