## 🧠 Psychology & Best Practices

### 1. Anchoring Effect

Show expensive first:
```
Premium $299/yr ←---- ANCHOR (makes others look cheap)
Lifetime $149   ←---- "Great deal!"
Pro $69.99/yr   ←---- "Even better deal!"
Pro $6.99/mo    ←---- "Super affordable!"
```

### 2. Decoy Pricing

```
Monthly:  $6.99/mo  = $83.88/year
Yearly:   $69.99/yr ← RECOMMENDED (save $14)
Lifetime: $149      ← "Just 2 years of Pro!"
```

The yearly option makes Lifetime look amazing!

### 3. Loss Aversion

```
"You've created 127 recordings worth $890 in value.
 Keep them safe with cloud sync for just $6.99/mo"
```

Fear of losing work > desire for features

### 4. Social Proof

```
"Join 10,000+ musicians who upgraded to Pro"
"Sarah from NY earned $3,200 on EoelWork last month"
```

### 5. Scarcity (Use Carefully!)

```
"Lifetime License: Early Adopter Price $149
 Regular price $199 (ends Dec 31)"
```

Only for launches/events, not permanent

### 6. Commitment & Consistency

```
Free → Pro Trial → Pro Monthly → Pro Yearly → Lifetime
 ↓       ↓            ↓              ↓            ↓
Try   Commit 7d   Commit 1mo   Commit 1yr   Commit Forever
```

Small commitments lead to larger ones

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't: Subscription Only

**Why it fails:**
- 62% of users prefer one-time payment
- Subscription fatigue is real
- Missing out on "ownership" psychology
- No upfront cash injection

### ❌ Don't: Lifetime Only

**Why it fails:**
- No recurring revenue (unpredictable)
- Can't fund ongoing development
- Servers/infrastructure cost monthly
- Hard to scale

### ❌ Don't: High Revenue Share (15-20%)

**Why it fails:**
- Fiverr/Upwork already do this (15-20%)
- Musicians will use platforms with lower fees
- 5-10% is competitive advantage
- Higher commission = fewer freelancers

### ❌ Don't: Complicated Pricing

**Bad example:**
```
Basic: $4.99
Plus: $9.99
Premium: $14.99
Ultra: $24.99
Mega: $49.99
```

**TOO MANY OPTIONS = DECISION PARALYSIS**

Keep it simple: Free, Pro, Lifetime, Premium

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### The Winning Strategy:

```yaml
TIER 1 - FREE:
  Price: $0
  Goal: Acquisition & viral growth

TIER 2 - PRO:
  Price: $6.99/mo or $69.99/yr
  Goal: Recurring revenue (MRR/ARR)

TIER 3 - LIFETIME:
  Price: $149 one-time
  Goal: Cash injection + ownership appeal

TIER 4 - PREMIUM:
  Price: $299/yr + 5% EoelWork commission
  Goal: Professional users + platform revenue
```

### Revenue Split Goal:

```
Year 1:
  50% Subscriptions ($477K)
  50% EoelWork ($450K)

Year 2:
  40% Subscriptions ($1.8M)
  60% EoelWork ($2.7M)

Year 3:
  30% Subscriptions
  70% EoelWork (primary revenue)
```

**EoelWork becomes the main business**, subscriptions are customer acquisition!
